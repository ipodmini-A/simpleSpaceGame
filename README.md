A simple top down shooter game.

Im honestly surprised you are here, well while you are here I might as well explain some things.
This is a unnamed top down shooter game. I am currently using Java with LibGDX to get more comfortable with game design.
In the future I will include a .jar file under releases, which all you would need is Java installed, but for now if you
would like to mess around with this, you will have to compile it yourself.

Currently as it stands, the code isn't clean at all. I am curently in the process of cleaning up the code before I go any further.
